# Raycaster
A simple ray caster from a viewpoint onto two spheres. 

# Background
This project was originally a school assignment in 2014, but I was unable to finish it on time back then. It was my first time ever programming and developing a ray caster from scratch was very daunting - I struggled immensely that quarter.

Now that I've gained much more experience and skill in programming, I wanted to revisit the project and complete it. 

# Programming Note
The specification I followed as of February 17th, 2016 was written specifically for Python. As a result, I have been forced to take certain liberties regarding function implementation. What works right now may not be the cleanest solution, but it gets the job done. 

# Before and After
I am also planning to upload the original C code I wrote in 2014 to highlight differences between my knowledge then and now. It will be uploaded upon my completion of this project.

# Disclaimer
As I have undertaken this project on my will from the Computer Science Department at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, I am more than willing to remove this code from GitHub at the request of any professor to prevent cheating from students who could have stumbled upon my code.
