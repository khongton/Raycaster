# Raycaster
A simple ray caster from a point onto two spheres. 

# Background
This project was originally a school assignment, but I was unable to finish it on time. It was first time ever programming and developing a ray caster from scratch was very daunting - you can imagine how the quarter went.

Now that I've gained much more experience in C, I wanted to give it another shot and attempt to complete it.
